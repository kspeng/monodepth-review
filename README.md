# Breif
This is a review note of monodepth method designed by author mrharicot (https://github.com/mrharicot). The preliminary step is to reproduce the results using the source code by mrharicot (https://github.com/mrharicot/monodepth.git). There are few unclear issues in author's instruction and they are clarified in this note. The next step is to improve the computational performance of this method. The note aims to provide a light neural net architecture to achieve real-time depth estimation (60fps) using the comercial gaming GPU (ex. Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti).
